# Build an Address Book App

## Overview

Your task is to build a simple Address Book App. The App should list all contacts, be able to view a contact's details and be able to create, edit and remove a contact from the list.

Other than the basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) features, you are free to add more features if you wish; for example a search feature or an avatar etc.

The app's platform is up to you; you can build a web app, mobile app, desktop app or even a terminal app.

## Technical Architecture

The following is required:

* Publish all source to a public GitHub repository
* The app's data must be persistent e.g. a database
* A `README.md` file to describe steps to running the app
* Use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the User Interface; this includes React Native

Suggestions but not required:

* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend (if applicable)
* [WebPack 2.x](https://webpack.github.io/) (if applicable)
* Use ES2015/16 syntax as much as possible via [babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) (if applicable)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

## UX and Design

You are not being judged on design, however you are being judged on UX :) The app must be simple and intuitive to the user. There are may examples of an address book to follow.

You can use any CSS/Design framework you wish (e.g. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/), [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) etc), but remember, you don't need to worry about browser compatibility so maybe using [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is enough??

## Data

This repository includes sample data of 500 dummy contacts (based in Australia). You can choose to use your own data, this data or no data... totally up to you. You might want to include a script that imports the data to your app, or load it on first launch; again up to you.

## Questions?

Feel free to ask any questions before, during and after your build. After all, you'll be part of a team.
